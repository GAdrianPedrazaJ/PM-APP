/**
 * Refreshes the authentication session if needed
 *
 * This function checks if the current session needs to be refreshed based on
 * the access token expiration time. If a refresh is needed, it will attempt to
 * refresh the token using the provided auth client.
 *
 * @param auth - The authentication client to use for token refresh
 * @param storage - The session storage implementation
 * @param marginSeconds - The number of seconds before the token expiration to refresh the session. If the token is still valid for this duration, it will not be refreshed. Set to 0 to force the refresh.
 * @returns A promise that resolves to the current session (refreshed if needed) or null if no session exists
